# Task 1: Code Correction 
# You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names
# that don't follow the Python naming convention. Your task is to correct them:

# Because this is a constant, it should be all caps.
PI_VALUE = 3.14
# Snake case (all lower case with underscores separating words) for variables
user_age = 25
user_location = "New York"
max_limit = 1000
